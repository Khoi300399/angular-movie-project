# MOVIE TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM

My project primarily manages the process of booking movie tickets at a theater, providing a user-friendly interface for easier ticket booking. The project progresses through a series of carefully designed forms, equipped with validation functions to ensure consistency, reliability, and most importantly, the accuracy of the information fed into the database.

## WORKING APPLICATION

Check out the **live demo** -> https://mtk-cinema.vercel.app/

## SOLUTION DESIGN

I have integrated various user interface widgets to enhance the result screen, making it easier for users to navigate the application without confusion. The overall architecture of the application can be considered to have two main parts:

- **The user side** (Done)

- **The admin side** (In Progress)

### The user side :

#### 1. Home Screen

This is Modal the user will see when he opens the application or `npm start`

##### 1.1 Login

- If the user is using the application for the first time, they can click on **Đăng ký** and register their personal information. Otherwise, they can log in using their credentials and proceed.
